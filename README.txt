My personal portfolio website
-----------------------------

Note : This is a work in progress. Being from a very technical background, building websites is new to me and this is my first attempt at making one
My portfolio being my first website might be a little risky but I like being thrown into the deep end :)

I thought creating my own portfolio website might make it easier for people to navigate though my projects rather than navigating through my many
repositories on Github. In addition, I am able to create more detailed project descriptions and write about the things I've learnt whilst doing
these projects, more than in my repos.

Hope you have fun looking through it!
